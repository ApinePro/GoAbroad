The lecture oppose the reading's opinion that（此处是阅读文章观点）

<font color = "green">zebra mussel would severly threat the freshwater fish populations in North Ameria</font>, **contending that the arguments in the reading passage are not convincing**.

Initially, while the reading stated that（此处是阅读文章第一段观点）

<font color = "green">according to zebra mussel's history, their spread could not be stopped</font>, the professor held an opposite opinion. He（注意听力中是男是女） claimed that（此处是听力第一个论点） <font color = "orange">in the past people could not stop mussel from spreading because they lack of knowledge. Nevertheless, now people could pour out the freshwater in the ballast water and refill with ocean water, which would kill mussel.</font>

**In addition, the professor casted doubt on the reading's assumption that**（此处是阅读文章第二段观点）<font color = "green"> mussels would dominate any new habitat</font>, arguing that（此处是听力第二个论点）<font color = "orange"> they could only occupy the place at beginning. It would not take a long time before some kinds of birds realize that mussels are new available food. Since a bird could eat a lot of mussels, they would not dominate the habitat.</font>

Moreover, the reading **maintained** that（此处是阅读文章第三段观点）<font color = "green"> zebra mussels would give rise to a decline in the overall fish population</font>, which is contradictory to what the professor said.<font color = "orange">Even if mussels could become dominant,</font> he argued（此处用了插入语，前后都是听力第三个论点）, <font color = "orange">the overall population would increase, as the existence of mussels would benefits other kinds of fish. For example, their waste could provide nutrient to bottom-feed fish, whose population would therefore grow.</font>
