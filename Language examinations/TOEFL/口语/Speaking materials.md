**Describe qualities of someone**:(Here is about neighbors)

> Here are my opinions about some characteristics of a good neighbor.
>
>  First, all good neighbors should be **considerate**. They will understand our need for space and privacy and **refrain from** interfering in our lives in an invasive manner, which means that, for example, he will mind the noise level in his house, and will never throw a late-night party, because he knows that such actions will surely bother others.
>
>  Second, a good neighbor should be there to **count on**. Last winter, when a thief  broke into my house when all my family members were away for work, it was my friendly neighbor who alerted the police in time and informed us immediately. This kind of **mutual assistance** can improve mutual understanding within the neighborhood, which is beneficial for social interaction.

**Library**：

> My favorite place to study is the campus library. I am **at my most** focused and efficient there for the following reasons.
>
> First,  libraries provide us with an almost unlimited source of papers and articles. If you need to find materials for your research paper, the staff are willing to help you find related scholarly articles through an online research tool. Moreover, this goes without saying that the library **houses a decent selection** of books.
>
> Second, the school library is also a great place to relax or do some reading. There are large windows with a nice view of the woods behind the campus, and comfortable chairs and the quiet atmosphere always make studying enjoyable. With **tons of resources at my fingertips** and all the warm-hearted librarians, the library has already become my favorite place to go.





**Computer games**:

> The playing of computer games is a **double-edged sword**.
>
>  On the up side, playing computer games often helps to develop kids’ **team spirit**. The key to winning games like Dota and World of Warcraft (WOW) is to be selfless and to **watch your teammates’ backs**. Kids who play computer games will have a profound experience of team spirit. Also, it is a good thing to relax with a computer game after a long day of study. It refreshes the mind **for the coming days**.
>
>  On the down side, playing computer games too often can be **detrimental** for both the physical and psychological **well-being** of kids. Exposure to screens for too long is bad for eyesight and sleep patterns. In addition, **game addicts** lack real life interaction with people,  so sometimes they will find it hard to get along with others.
