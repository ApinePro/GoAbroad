#Argument

先找结论!!!

##1. 逻辑错误

###1.1. 证据
####1.1.1. 调查错误

Marked by: survey / census / study / test, sample / respondent / response / answer (__quality__), many / most (__quantity__), some numbers XX / some percentages XX% (__value__)
#####攻击点

######1) 样本没有代表性 (样本质量) (scope)

... constitute a representative sample of ... the overall group of ...

are typical / representative of 

chances are that these respondents are aberrations

a. 一些population没有被sample

did not reach out to certain groups of population 

biased as it might have purposefully avoided ... 

b. 一些sample不属于被讨论的population

c. people inclined to \<SURVEY PREFERENCE> were more willing to respond to the survey that other people were 

######2) 样本数量不足 

quantity of respondents is statistically significant

the mere sample of ... is too limited / far from statistically significant to constitute convincing evidence / ... assumption ...

######3) Measurement Error

a. 调查的问题不恰当: 与结论无直接联系或misleading

the question asked in the survey ... has little to do with  / has no bearing on .. / is not a determinant factor in whether or not ... might have misled / swayed the respondent to give answers desired by the investigator

b. 样本没有说真话due to social desirability effect (lie to justify himself, 符合主流价值观) or misled / swayed

the survey might be biased by social desirability effect, the respondent might have given answers favorable by others due to moral pressure

c. 态度不能反映行为

common sense informs us that people do not necessarily make decision / act in strict accordance with their expressed desires / attitudes. 

######4) Validity

a. 时效性: 在很久以前或某特殊时期进行, 结果不能反映现在或将来的情况

b. Reliability / Neutrality: 调查机构与调查结果有利益相关

######5) 数据问题

一者多 / 少不能反映另者多 / 少

a. 有相对值无绝对值

... does not necessarily indicate a sufficiently large / small ... as the base amount is not given

although ... seems significant, ... might actually be 

b. 有绝对值无相对值

we are not informed of what fraction of ... is actually

c. 有 != 多

#####Template

A threshold problem with the argument involves the statistical reliability of the survey. (__指出调查错误__)

the methodology of the survey might be problematic in ... respects ...

The author provides no evidence that the number of respondents is statistically significant (for __quantity, 代表性__) or that the respondents were representative of \<POPULATION> in general (for __quality__).

Moreover, common sense informs me that \<RESPONDENTS> do not necessarily make decision / act in strict accordance with their expressed desires / attitudes. (__态度不能反映行为__)

Thus, as it stands the statistics that the argument cites amounts to scant (barely or scarcely sufficient) evidence that ... (__联系结论__)

the survey lends little support for ..

Unless the survey is fully representative, valid and reliable, it cannot be used to effectively buttress / collaborate the author's argument.

####1.1.2. 论据模糊

Marked by: promise / plan / guess

#####攻击点

计划不一定会实现

#####Template

... might not be realized.

it is obscure / vague whether ...

###1.2. 推导

####1.2.1. 因果关系

Marked by:  because / therefore / cause / reason, some time ago (__时序性__), meanwhile / during (__同时性__), link / connection / association

#####攻击点

######1) 时序性

A先发生于B -> A causes B

Template:

I. 针对时序性

The mere fact that A occurred before B does not suffice to prove that A caused B. (__指出时序性因果错误__)

(assume) A bring about B based on the fact that A occurred before B

however the sequence of these events, in itself, does not suffice to prove that the former caused the latter

B might have resulted from a myriad of other factors such as ...

Perhaps the true cause was C or D. (__列举他因__)

In short, while A would likely cause B, a concrete connection between A and B is not effectively make without ruling out other factors. (__联系结论__)

II. 只列举他因

The author fails to present a sound correlation between A and B. (__指出因果错误__)

There are likely a myriad of other reasons that cause B. 

For example, it might be because C or D.

In addition, it is also possible that E.

In short, the author needs to provide more evidence to rule out these possibilities and prove that A is the only sufficient reason that leads to B. (__联系结论__)

######2) 同时性

A coincides with B -> A causes B

列举他因, 

Template:

I. 列举他因

The editorial assumes too hastily that B is attributable to A, rather than some other phenomenon. (__指出因果错误__)

it is true that ... coincides / parallels with ... , but the mere fact itself does not suffice to establish causal relationship between the former and the latter, for there are a myriad of other possible explanations

Perhaps B had to do with C.

Or perhaps ... for reasons unrelated to A.

Without ruling out these and other alternative explanations for B, the editorial cannot convince me that ... (__联系结论__)

II. 混淆因果 (maybe B causes A)

The author might have confused cause with effect - by assuming that A caused B rather than vice versa. (__指出因果错误__)

It is entirely possible that B cause A.

In fact this scenario makes good sense since ... (__联系结论__)

######3) 强加因果

列举他因, 若有A -> B -> C, 可先否定A -> B, 再让步: even if A -> B, 也没有B -> C

... is responsible for ...

each one of these can bring about the same result



the arguer cannot establish a convincing case-and-effect relationship upon which the recommendation depends

####1.2.2. 时间外推

Marked by: some time ago, trend, continue / remain			

####攻击点

过去 / 现在这样做成功或失败了 -> 现在 / 将来这样做也会成功或失败

列举时间轴上可能的变化: 

a. 影响其成功或失败的因素有...

b. 这些因素从过去 / 现在到现在 / 将来可能会发生那些变化

对一个时间段 (last year / last month, ...) 的一个套路:

a. 时间太短, 搜集不到足够数据

insufficient data has been collected during such a short period as ... to draw any reliable conclusion

b. 该时间段可能为例外, 在历史上其他阶段可能并无此成功 / 失败, 故不可代表过去

... in this short period might just be exceptional / aberrant from other historical periods, thus much less representative of an overall history ...

c. 再列举时间轴上可能的变化, 不可代表未来

#####Template

a.

The author assumes that this current trend in XX will surely continue / be equally ... in the future; yet he offers no evidence to substantiate this assumption. (__指出时间外推__)

It is entirely possible that ...

It is also probable that ... (__列举变化__) 

Without considering these possible scenarios, the author cannot justifiably conclude that ... (__联系结论__)

b.

The author assumes that all other conditions that might affect \<FACTORS> will remain unchanged after XX years. (__指出影响措施的关键因素__)

However, ... might ...

Also, ... might ... (__列举变化__)

Without considering and ruling out these possible changes that might contribute to \<FACTORS>, the author cannot convince me that the proposed measure will necessary have the desired effect. (__联系结论__)

... might actually portend failure for ...

####1.2.3. 比较错误

Marked by: similar / same, nearby / neighboring, 公司名 / 地名

#####攻击点

a. A采取某措施取得成功 / 失败 -> B采取该措施也成功 / 失败

列举差异性: 证明A与B不一样，在A成功的措施在B不一定成功

ex. ability to enforce / enact such measure, 具体情况

Template:

question ... whether A is truly analogous to B

evidence that might help us evaluate this claim involves the comparability between A and B

relies on the assumption that A is analogous to B, provides no evidence that the two are similar in ways that are relevant to the argument

A and B might differ conspicuously

In asserting that the same phenomenon / measure that caused XX in A would cause a similar XX in B, (__指出错误位置__) the author relies on what might amount to an unfair analogy between A and B. (__指出错误位置__)

Perhaps ... ; (__差异性1__) if not, then the mere enactment of the similar measure in B is no guarantee of a similar result (__联系结论__)

Or perhaps ... ; (__差异性2__) then  the proposed measure is likely to have less impact on XX in B than A. (__联系结论__)

b. 与`时间外推`结合: A在过去采取某措施取得成功 -> B现在 / 将来采取该措施也同样成功

不断让步

b.1. `因果错误`: A成功不一定因为该措施

b.2. `时间外推`: 过去可以成功将来不一定可以成功

b.3. `比较错误`: A可以成功不代表B也可以成功

c. 整体个体: 整体具有某特征 -> 个体也具有该特征, vice versa

Marked by: nationwide / statewide, throughout / overall / across, 地名

列举差异性

Template:

c.1. 整体推个体

One problem with the argument is that it assumes that the nationwide statistics about \<整体> applies equally to \<个体>. (__指出整体推个体__)

Yet this might not be the case, for a variety of possible reasons.

Perhaps ...

Or perhaps ... (__列举差异性__)

Without ruling out such possibilities, the author cannot justifiably conclude that ... (__联系结论__)

c.2. 个体推整体

The author assumes \<个体> is representative of all \<整体> generally. (__指出个体推整体__)

It is entirely possible that ...

Or perhaps ... (__列举差异性__)

Without accounting for such possibilities, the author cannot convince me that ... (__联系结论__)

d. 平均值

平均值大 / 小 -> 某个体值大 / 小

Marked by: average

列举差异性

可能受极端数据outlier影响

####1.2.4. 偷换概念

#####攻击点

证据中的概念A != 结论中的概念B

a. 下定义: 给 (一般是结论中的) 关键概念下定义，指出证据中概念于此无关

Template:

a.1.

A threshold problem involves the definition of B. (__指出错误__)

The speaker fails to define this critical term.

If B is defined as ... , then A is irrelevant to B. (__下定义__)

In short, without a clear definition of B it is impossible to assess the strength of the argument. (__联系结论__)

a.2. 

The mere fact that ... is not the key in determining whether ...

The key instead is ...

It is entirely possible that ...

b. 推不出: 列举可能解释, 说明证据推不出结论 (虽然但是, 即使也)

Template:

b.1.

assume that A is a sure indicator of B

A do not necessarily indicate / mean that B. / A is no / little indication that B. (__指出概念A != B__)

Perhaps ... , or ...

For that matter, perhaps ... (__解释推不出的原因__)

In short, without ruling out other possible reasons for A the author cannot convince me on the basis of them that B, let alone the \<CONCLUSION>. (__联系结论__)

b.2. 让步衔接

Even if 前文成立, the author assumes further that A is correlated to B.

Yet the memo / argument contains / provide no evidence to support this assumption.

Lacking such evidence it is equally possible that aside from A, not B.

In fact, perhaps ... (__解释推不出的原因__) 

###1.3. 结论

结论部分逻辑错误一般放最后

####1.3.1. 利润问题

#####攻击点

a.

Marked by: profitable / income / cost / expense

使用某种措施可带来很高 / 更高收入 -> 可提高利润

使用某种措施可降低成本 -> 可提高利润

根据profit = revenue - cost

Template:

Even if 前文所述都正确, XX would not necessarily be profitable as a result. (__否认盈利__)

Profitability is a function of / a factor influenced by both revenue and expense. (__解释理由__)

It is entirely possible that XX's cost of ... or ... would render it unprofitable despite its popularity. (__列举会提高成本或降低收入的因素__) offset or even outweigh

Without weighing revenue against expenses the argument's conclusion is premature at best. (__联系结论__)

b. 正负得失

Marked by: beneficial / advantage / disadvantage

只论述好 / 坏处, 未论述坏 / 好处

先逐条反驳好 / 坏处, 再让步表明即使有好 / 坏处, 也不定超过坏 / 好处

Template:

The author fails to weigh disadvantage against advantage about XX thoroughly since he makes no mention of the advantage of XX. (__否定结论__)

It is entirely possible that ... or ... might render it beneficial despite its disadvantages. (__列举会有利 / 害的因素__)

since advantage in all likelihood outweigh disadvantage, it might be unwise / ill-advised to ...

Without weighing advantages against disadvantages the arguments's conclusion is premature at best. (__联系结论__) 

####1.3.2. 条件问题

#####攻击点

a. 充分 A -> B

Marked by: once, will / be going to

A不能导致B: 会受其他因素阻碍 / 需要其他因素帮助

Template:

The recommendation depends on the unsubstantiated assumption that adopting  \<SUGGESTION> would by itself / alone (suffice to) improve \<GOAL> to the desired extent.

Absent evidence that this is the case, it is equally possible that adopting the \<SUGGESTION> would not suffice by itself.

If ... , the suggestion will not be effective. (__攻击充分性, 会受其他因素阻碍__)

other ... method might prove indispensable to 

In short, unless the author can show that the suggestion will be effectively implemented and received, I cannot accept the recommendation.

b. 必要 A \<- B

Marked by: without, necessary, only

其他条件要可以导致B

Template:

The recommendation depends on the assumption that no alternative means of improving \<GOAL> are available. 

Yet no evidence is offered to substantiate this assumption.

It is entirely possible that means other than \<SUGGESTION> would also achieve the desired result.

Perhaps the desired goal could be achieved if ... , or ... , or simply ...

Without considering and ruling out these and other alternative means of improving \<GOAL>, the author cannot confidently conclude that ... must adopt \<SUGGESTION> in order to achieve the desired goal.

 c. 充要 A \<-> B

Marked by: if, will / be going to (较为模糊, 攻击作者assume A与B充要)

不充分 & 不必要

Template:

The author falsely assumes that \<SUGGESTION> is both __necessary and sufficient__ to achieve the stated objectives. (__指出不充要__)

Perhaps XX can achieve those objectives by other means as well - for example, by ... (__攻击必要性__)

Even if \<SUGGESTION> is necessary to meet the goals, the author has not shown that this action by itself would suffice. 

\<OBJECTIVES> might requires other measures such as ... (__攻击充分性, 需要其他因素帮助__)

####1.3.3. 非此即彼

Marked by: either ... or ...

#####攻击点

两原因 / 解决方法: 非A即B

a. 列举他因 / 其他方法

Template:

a.1. 列举他法

One question which needs to be addressed before implementing the recommendation is whether there are not other ways to ... (__指出有其他可能__)

Without proof, the author decides that there are only two viable option for \<CONCLUSION>: either A or B. (__指出非此即彼__)

But it seems there may be alternative methods of \<CONCLUSION>, such as C and D. (__列举其他方法__)

either scenario, if true, could ...

a.2. 列举他因

Even assuming A is not the reason for \<RESULT>, the author falsely assumes the the \<RESULT> must be attributable only to B. (__指出非此即彼__)

This "either-or" argument is fallacious in that it ignores other possible cause of \<RESULT>. (__指出有其他可能__)

For example, perhaps C or D. (__列举他因__)

b. A可与B共同作用 

Template:

However, this assumption presents a false dilemma / either-or fallacy, since A and B are not necessarily mutually exclusive. (__指出并非互斥__)

####1.3.4. 可行性

#####攻击点

建议 / 措施不可行

the feasibility of the arguer;s proposal can be cast doubt upon / is open to doubt.

it is highly questionable / dubious whether

it remains to be seen whether 

####1.3.5. 绝对化词汇

Marked by: all / any / anything, everybody, best, only, -est
