In this memo the business manager of Happy Pancake House (HPH) recommends that HPH should replace butter 
with margarine at all its restaurants to save the expense of butter. The recommendation is 
based on the fact that HPH's southwestern restaurants has made this replacement and then 
only 2% of their customers have complained about it. The manager further cites reports from 
many servers of these restaurants that a number of customers asking for butter do not 
complain when given margarine instead. Logical as it seems at first thought, the memo, 
nevertheless, is rife with vague, oversimplified and unsubstantiated assumptions after 
scrutinized, thus rendered unpersuasive as it stands.
